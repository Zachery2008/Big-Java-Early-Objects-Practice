  <li value="12">The bank needs to store the list of customers so that
customers can log in. We
need to locate all bank accounts of a customer, and we chose to simply

to access
bank accounts.</li>

accounts. The bank can carry out this responsibility because it has
access to the
customer objects and, through them, to the bank accounts.</li>
